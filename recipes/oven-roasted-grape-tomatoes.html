                1 lb of grape tomatoes, sliced in half
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tbsp of olive oil

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>

                Place tomatoes onto a large square of aluminum foil. Drizzle olive oil over tomatoes and top with garlic, basil, thyme, and salt. Wrap the foil around tomato mixture sealing tightly to keep juices inside.
