# odin-recipes

Odin Recipes is a website of recipes. This project uses unordered lists to list ingredients and ordered lists to list the steps one would take to complete the side dishes. Each recipe page has an image embeded into them with the <img> tag.

The different pages of recipes are also relatively linked to the index.html page with anchor tags.
